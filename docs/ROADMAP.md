   - Add code comments
   - Update examples

5. **Verify no regressions**

   - Check clippy
   - Format code

### Testing Strategy

For each new feature:
```bash
# Run specific tests
cargo test <test_name>

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with features
cargo test --all-features

# Check for regressions
./scripts/check-test.sh
./scripts/check-clippy.sh

- Maximum confidence
- Best operational experience

**Recommendation**: Option A or B
